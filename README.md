**Day 1 of the Master IOT Journey**

*NOTE*
2 types: HIGH and LOW => indicate VOLTAGE LEVEL

1. Control 1 LED

*Operating Principle*

These pins that has the same number (1a, 1b) or (2a, 2b) is always connect. But, these differences number (1 - 2) is not connect. They only connect when push the button.
When push the button, the electric move from postive to negative. Example, in above image, I use resistor has value = 10k (Ohm) and supply power 30(V). So, I can calculate value of I based on Ohm's law 
        I = U/R = 30/10000 = 3 (mA)
